Welcome to my personal website!

I am a macroeconomist specializing in **International Macroeconomics** and **Monetary Economics**, with additional interest in the macroeconomics of climate change. My research focuses on monetary policy transmission, considering international spillovers.

**I am on the 2025/26 job market.**
