Welcome to my personal website!

I am a macroeconomist with interests in **International Macroeconomics** and **Monetary Economics**, as well as the **Macroeconomics of Climate Change**.

My Job Market Paper focuses on the transmission of monetary policy, considering international spillovers.

**I am on the 2025/26 job market.**
