### Limits to Monetary Policy: When Central Banks Diverge *(Job Market Paper)*
<details>
  <summary><strong>Show abstract</strong></summary>
  <p>
The high degree of financial and economic integration implies that monetary policy decisions by major central banks have substantial cross-border effects. This paper studies how divergence across major central banks shapes the transmission of domestic monetary policy. Using state-dependent local projections, I show that the transmission of European Central Bank (ECB) policy reverses when Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy is of the opposite sign. During U.S. monetary expansions, an ECB tightening attracts capital inflows to the euro area and overturns its contractionary effects on output and inflation. By contrast, a Fed tightening is contractionary regardless of ECB policy. A two-country New Keynesian DSGE model rationalizes these findings. The model augments a standard framework with financial frictions via a global investor and assumes (i) the U.S. dollar is the dominant international funding currency, (ii) a no-arbitrage condition links returns on home and foreign capital, and (iii) uncovered interest parity fails due to frictions in international asset markets. In this environment, an easier U.S. policy lowers dollar funding costs and generates asymmetric cross-border spillovers that condition the transmission of ECB policy.

    This paper quantifies the macroeconomic and welfare effects of time-varying volatility inclimate damages. We first report the number of climate-related events and the average, maximum, and total physical costs as a share of GDP. The frequency of costly events has risen steadily since the 1980s, and total costs over GDP have increased by a factor of three 3 by 2023. Moreover, the decade-specific maximum cost fluctuates from 0.36% to 0.99%, indicating greater variability. Taken together, these patterns point to rising uncertainty about the future incidence and severity of climate-related losses.
We build a closed-economy DSGE real business cycle model with energy use in which accumulated atmospheric CO2 reduces productivity, and we extend the framework to allow the volatility impact of CO2 accumulation to vary over time through its effect on the Solow residual. The model is calibrated to U.S. business-cycle moments, energy consumption, and the observed evolution of atmospheric carbon. We derive analytical generalized impulse response functions (GIRFs) to analyze the economy’s responses to productivity shocks, climate-damage (level) shocks, and its volatility shocks. A climate-damage (level) shock generates a business-cycle response that is larger and more persistent than that produced by a standard productivity shock. A volatility shock—an increase in uncertainty about climate damages at a given CO2 level—produces responses of endogenous variables that are of similar magnitude to those following a level shock but display greater persistence. The shock induces precautionary behavior that affects consumption, investment, energy use, and labor supply, generating negative effects on real macroeconomic variables.
Finally, we assess welfare using a consumption-equivalent metric and compare economies with (i) no climate costs and (ii) no climate risks. The welfare costs of climate risk are quantitatively sizable and exceed benchmark business-cycle costs, being more than four times those reported by Lucas (1987). These results underscore the importance of incorporating risk—not only average damages—into the macroeconomic assessment of climate change and into the design of climate policies.
