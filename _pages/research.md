### Limits to Monetary Policy: When Central Banks Diverge *(Job Market Paper)*
<details>
  <summary><strong>Show abstract</strong></summary>
  <p>
This paper studies how monetary policy divergence across major central banks conditions the transmission of domestic monetary policy. Using state-dependent local projections, the empirical analysis shows that the transmission of European Central Bank (ECB) policy weakens when Federal Reserve (Fed) shocks have the opposite sign. In particular, during U.S. monetary expansions, an ECB tightening shock attracts capital inflows to the euro area and generates counterintuitive movements in domestic activity and prices. By contrast, a Fed tightening remains unambiguously contractionary. A two-country New Keynesian model with a global investor is consistent with these findings. The mechanism operates through incomplete international asset markets and the dominant role of the U.S. dollar in global funding, which—through return equalization—produces asymmetric cross-border spillovers that condition the transmission of ECB policy.
