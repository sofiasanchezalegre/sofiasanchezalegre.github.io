The high degree of financial and economic integration implies that monetary policy decisions by major central banks have substantial cross-border effects. This paper studies how divergence across major central banks shapes the transmission of domestic monetary policy. Using state-dependent local projections, I show that the transmission of European Central Bank (ECB) policy reverses when Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy is of the opposite sign. During U.S. monetary expansions, an ECB tightening attracts capital inflows to the euro area and overturns its contractionary effects on output and inflation. By contrast, a Fed tightening is contractionary regardless of ECB policy. A two-country New Keynesian DSGE model rationalizes these findings. The model augments a standard framework with financial frictions via a global investor and assumes (i) the U.S. dollar is the dominant international funding currency, (ii) a no-arbitrage condition links returns on home and foreign capital, and (iii) uncovered interest parity fails due to frictions in international asset markets. In this environment, an easier U.S. policy lowers dollar funding costs and generates asymmetric cross-border spillovers that condition the transmission of ECB policy.

We quantify the macroeconomic and welfare effects of time-varying uncertainty in climate damages. Using historical evidence since the 1980s, we document that the frequency of costly climate events has risen and that total physical costs (as a share of GDP) have roughly tripled by 2023; decade-specific maximum losses fluctuate between 0.36% and 0.99%, signaling increasing variability. We develop a closed-economy RBC-DSGE model with energy use in which accumulated atmospheric CO₂ depresses productivity and—in addition—raises the volatility of the Solow residual over time. Calibrated to U.S. business-cycle moments, energy use, and carbon dynamics, the model yields analytical generalized impulse response functions. A level shock to climate damages generates larger and more persistent downturns than a standard productivity shock. A volatility shock—greater uncertainty about damages at a given CO₂ level—induces precautionary adjustments in consumption, investment, energy use, and labor, producing contractions comparable in size to level shocks but with greater persistence. Welfare analysis shows that climate risk imposes sizable costs that exceed conventional business-cycle costs, surpassing the Lucas (1987) benchmark by more than a factor of four. The results highlight the need to incorporate risk—beyond average damages—into macroeconomic assessments and climate policy design.
